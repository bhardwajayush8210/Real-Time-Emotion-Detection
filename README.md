# 🎭 AI Real-Time Emotion Detection System

An advanced real-time Facial Emotion Detection system built using Deep Learning (CNN) and deployed using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces.

This system detects multiple faces from live webcam or uploaded images and classifies emotions with confidence scores, probability visualization, and a live emotion statistics dashboard.
